# Arrow data grid component.

A plug-and-play component for rendering [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/) tables. It is based on [Material UI data grid component](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/). Thanks to metadata included into Apache Arrow tables this component works out of the box for the most common data types without a need to be configured. It can be easily extended for custom data types.
