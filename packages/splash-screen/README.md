# Installer splash screen

Splash screen for the Conda environment installer in the Electron app.

_NOTE_: This component is used in a utility window in the Electron app and is supposed to be lightweight and have no dependencies on other `@lumy` packages. If dependencies are introduced, the build configuration for the Electron app may need to be updated.
